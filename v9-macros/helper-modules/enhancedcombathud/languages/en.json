This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see.

Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include \"If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it,\" and \"If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.\"</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6c8b0166-9e42-42fa-9ef6-6c01381032c9\">When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.

To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the&nbsp;web&nbsp;spell and ready&nbsp;magic missile, your&nbsp;web&nbsp;spell ends, and if you take damage before you release&nbsp;magic missile&nbsp;with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.</p>",

    "enhancedcombathud.skills.dec.tooltip": "Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions.

    "enhancedcombathud.skills.ins.tooltip": "Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move.

    "enhancedcombathud.abilities.con.tooltip": "<p>Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.</p><p><strong>Constitution Checks</strong><br/>Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster.

Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.</p><p>If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you're 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.</p>",
