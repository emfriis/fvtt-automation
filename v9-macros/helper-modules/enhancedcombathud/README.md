# FAQs

Q: Can you add compatibility for X system?
A: No, Argon is hardcoded for dnd5e. If you want you can make a fork for a specific system. You have to include the licence section and credit the original authors (theripper93, Mouse0270) and include links to our patreon page\website (if provided).

Q: Why is this kind of item not in the HUD?
A: We had to make a choice on what to include, anything that's not on those categories is not icluded (a 1 minute cast time spell for example, or a consumable that is used as bonus action). Those items will not be addedd. You can use Sets for any item.

Q: Why the items in the HUD are not updating correctly?
A: Only a select number of elements are dynamically updated. If you (for example) add an item to a sheet the change will not be reflected. To update the HUD simply close\reopen
