# Overview
## Attack Spells and Melee attacks require a token(s) to be Targeted

As of release 0.5.0, Automated Animations has implemented the SEQUENCER module as a Dependancy. You can now think of A-A as a *lightweight* Sequence builder. For more customized animation sequences, use the the Sequencer module is highly recommended.   

Automated Animations reads the data passed through Chat Cards, or Module Hooks, to get the required information. Items (Spells, Weapons, etc) that have a **name** matching a **JB2A animation** will automatically play an animation on use. This generally occurs on the Attack Roll, with options for playing Animations on Damage Rolls. All **default** colors for available animations are based on the **Free** JB2A Module. To use color variants, you need to have the **Patreon** version of the JB2A Module.  

# External Calls for Animations  
Other modules can now call animations through Automated Animations by using:  
**AutoAnimations.playAnimation(sourceToken, targets, item)**  
Parameters are as follows:
- sourceToken: The Token instance that is using the item  
- targets: passed as an Array
- item: the item instance that is being used
